# DokkanDMGCalc
This is a script to calculate the damage taken from a super attack in Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle.  

The script has modifiers for you to enter in your character's defense post super and buffs, the enemy super attack dmg (which can be retrived from [Dokkan Info](https://dokkaninfo.com/) ), and if applicable to the character, the values for damage reduction, type and class disadvantage/advantage, and guard. The script will give you the damage taken from the super attack as the output when all the relevant values are plugged in.
